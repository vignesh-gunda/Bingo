# User Profile Access (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes how users access their profile and settings from the Lobby Page on a mobile device.

## Visual Elements
*   **Profile Icon/Avatar:**
    *   A small, tappable icon (e.g., a generic person icon, user's avatar if set) typically located in a corner of the Lobby screen.
*   **Settings/Hamburger Menu (if profile is part of a larger menu):**
    *   A menu icon that expands to reveal options including "My Profile," "Settings," "Help," "Logout," etc.
*   **Profile Summary (optional):**
    *   Brief display of username or level next to the icon.

## User Interaction
*   Tapping the profile icon or navigating through a menu leads the user to their personal profile page or a settings menu.
*   The profile page should allow users to view/edit personal information, check game history, manage notifications, etc.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Icon should be easily tappable without being obstructive to the main Lobby content.
*   Consistent placement (e.g., top-left or top-right corner) for easy discoverability.
*   Profile/settings screens should be well-organized and easy to navigate on a small screen.
