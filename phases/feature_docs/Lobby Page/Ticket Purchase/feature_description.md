# Ticket Purchase (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document outlines the user flow for confirming their selected numbers and initiating a Bingo game from the Lobby Page on a mobile device. This process follows the "NUMBERS" selection detailed in the Game Selection feature.

## Visual Elements
*   **Confirmation of Selected Numbers:**
    *   (Implicitly handled by the "NUMBERS" selection in Game Selection).
*   **PLAY Button:**
    *   A prominent "PLAY" button that, once tapped, finalizes the ticket (selected numbers) and starts the game. This button is actionable only after 9 unique numbers have been selected.
*   **Cost Display:**
    *   Display of the cost to play the game (e.g., 1000 coins per player as shown in the lobby image).

## User Interaction
*   After selecting 9 unique numbers via the "NUMBERS" interface (described in Game Selection), the "PLAY" button becomes active.
*   Users tap the "PLAY" button to confirm their numbers and join the game.
*   Upon successful initiation by all the users, the players transition to the Bingo game screen.

## Mobile Considerations
*   The "PLAY" button should be clearly visible and easily tappable.
*   Clear indication of when the "PLAY" button is active/inactive.
*   Smooth transition between the Lobby and Bingo game screens.
