# Ticket Purchase (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document outlines the user flow for confirming their selected numbers and initiating a Bingo game from the Lobby Page on a mobile device.
## Visual Elements
*   **Confirmation of Selected Numbers:**
    *   There are nine circular slots in a 3 by 3 grid.
    *   Each slot is blank when the player comes to the screen for the first time
    *   Each slot can be rolled from 1 to 50. This is similar to how a user inputs their birth date in any app. They scroll to find the right number. Here the user can scroll from 1 to 50. 
*   **PLAY Button:**
    *   A prominent "PLAY" button that, once tapped, finalizes the ticket (selected numbers) and starts the game. This button is actionable only after 9 unique numbers have been selected.
  
## User Interaction
*   After selecting 9 unique numbers, the "PLAY" button becomes active.
*   Users tap the "PLAY" button to confirm their numbers and transition to the Bingo game screen.

## Mobile Considerations
*   The "PLAY" button should be clearly visible and easily tappable.
*   Clear indication of when the "PLAY" button is active/inactive.
*   Smooth transition between the Lobby and Bingo game screens.
*   Play buttom is at the bottom of the screen.
