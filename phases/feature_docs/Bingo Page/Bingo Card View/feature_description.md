# Bingo Card View (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes the display and interaction with the user's Bingo card(s) during an active game on a mobile device. The bingo card features a 3x3 grid.
This will be in the top half of the page.

## Visual Elements
*   **Bingo Card Grid:**
    *   Clear, legible display of numbers in a 3x3 grid format.
    *   Users can highlight numbers in 'amethyst', with the original highlight color being 'gold'.
    *   The background is black, and the letters are white.

## User Interaction
*   Users can manually tap to mark numbers on their card as they are called.
*   Visual feedback when a number is successfully marked, with user-specific highlight colors.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Card must be large enough for easy tapping/marking of individual numbers.
*   Clear contrast between marked and unmarked numbers, and between different highlight states.
*   Performance optimization to ensure smooth updates as numbers are called.
