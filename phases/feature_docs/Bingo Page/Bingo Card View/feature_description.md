# Bingo Card View (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes the display and interaction with the user's Bingo card(s) during an active game on a mobile device.

## Visual Elements
*   **Bingo Card Grid:**
    *   Clear, legible display of numbers in the classic 5x5 (or other format) Bingo grid.
    *   Highlighting for the "Free Space" (if applicable).
    *   Multiple cards should be easily switchable (e.g., swipe, tabs) or viewable simultaneously (if screen allows).
*   **Marked Numbers:**
    *   Numbers that have been called should be clearly marked/daubed on the card.
    *   Different visual states for manually marked vs. auto-marked numbers (if auto-daub is a feature).
*   **Game Information Overlay:**
    *   Small display of game ID, time remaining, current prize.

## User Interaction
*   Users can manually tap to mark numbers on their card as they are called.
*   (If auto-daub is a feature) Users can toggle automatic marking of called numbers.
*   Users can easily switch between multiple cards they are playing.
*   Visual feedback when a number is successfully marked.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Card must be large enough for easy tapping/marking of individual numbers.
*   Pinch-to-zoom or scrolling for multiple cards if necessary.
*   Clear contrast between marked and unmarked numbers.
*   Performance optimization to ensure smooth updates as numbers are called.
