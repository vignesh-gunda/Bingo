# Game Chat (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes the in-game chat functionality for players on the mobile Bingo game screen.

## Visual Elements
*   **Chat Window/Overlay:**
    *   A collapsible or scrollable chat area, usually at the bottom or side of the screen.
    *   Displays messages from other players and system notifications.
*   **Message Input Field:**
    *   A text input field for users to type their messages.
*   **Send Button:**
    *   A button to send the typed message.
*   **(Optional) Emojis/Stickers Button:**
    *   Access to a selection of emojis or game-specific stickers.

## User Interaction
*   Users can type and send messages to other players in the game.
*   Chat history should be visible and scrollable.
*   (Optional) Profanity filtering and moderation tools.
*   New message notifications (e.g., a badge on the chat icon) when the chat is collapsed.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Chat should be easily accessible but also able to be minimized to avoid obstructing the main game view.
*   Keyboard integration must be smooth.
*   Message bubbles and text size should be legible on small screens.
*   Consider notifications that don't disrupt gameplay (e.g., small pop-ups or scrolling text).
