# Winning Pattern Indicator (Mobile Screen View)

## Feature Description
This document describes how the application visually indicates potential or actual winning Bingo patterns on the user's mobile screen.

## Visual Elements
*   **Highlighting Potential Wins:**
    *   As numbers are marked, lines or cells on the Bingo card that are close to forming a winning pattern should be subtly highlighted.
*   **Clear Win Indication:**
    *   When a winning pattern is achieved, the specific winning line(s) or pattern should be prominently highlighted (e.g., bright color, animation, distinct border).
*   **Notification:**
    *   A visual notification (e.g., banner, pop-up) indicating a potential or actual Bingo.

## User Interaction
*   Users should easily see when they are close to a Bingo.
*   The winning pattern should be unmistakable when achieved, guiding the user to claim.
*   The indicator should be intuitive and not require explicit user action to appear.

## Mobile Considerations
*   Visual cues must be distinct but not overly distracting.
*   Ensuring highlights are visible on various screen sizes and color themes.
*   Avoid overlapping with other critical UI elements.
